    "2) What functionalities in initialization, execution and termination are shared between these algorithms? Which are not shared?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initialization: Both methods initialize and M x N matrix where M is the length of seq1 and N is the length of seq2. However, in initializing the SW matrix, you set the first row and first column to 0. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Execution: Both methods share methods for calculating the score at a particular cell in the matrix. This entails taking the max of the three following scores:\n",
    "        a) Gap from left to right\n",
    "        b) Gap from top to bottom\n",
    "        c) Match\n",
    "    However, SW adds an extra option where you can reset to 0 if the score goes negative.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Termination: Both methods have to use the traceback matrix to return an alignment. NW must start at the lower rightmost cell and trace back all the way to the start and return that string. SW needs to start at the max element in the matrix and trace back until a 0 is reached, then return the resulting string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) How does affine-gap based alignment differ from linear-gap alignment in terms of implementation?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Affine gap alignment requires you to keep track of the gap status of the previous cell when computing the score of the current cell (gap start, match/mismatch, gap extension). To return the optimal alignment you need two extra score matrices, one for seq1 and one for seq2, which keep track of the max score of either opening or extending a gap at the current cell. For the final traceback you would need to interface between the original score matrix and these two extra matrices to get the alignment."
